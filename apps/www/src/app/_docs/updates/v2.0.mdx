One of Luxe's biggest launches yet is here. This new version introduces powerful components with variant props, a new CLI, and a complete redesign.

My goal is to build apps in the easiest way possible, using intuitive, beautiful, and functional components. This new version is a big step in that direction. I believe that what we want most is _"Build fast, ship with style"_.

#### Variant Props

In the previous version, customizing components wasn't as straightforward. Now, you can easily customize components using the <CodeHighlight>variant</CodeHighlight> props.

<div className="relative w-full h-[300px] sm:h-[540px] rounded-xl border border-transparent dark:border-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-8 overflow-hidden">

<video src="/videos/v2.0/variant-props.mp4" className="absolute z-10 inset-0 size-full object-cover rounded-[inherit]" autoPlay muted loop playsInline />

<Image src="/images/v2.0/variant-props.jpg" className="absolute z-0 inset-0 size-full object-cover rounded-[inherit] blur-sm" alt="Variant props" />

</div>

As shown in the video above, it's now much simpler to apply styles. Previously, using <CodeHighlight>ButtonGlitchBrightness</CodeHighlight> required importing a separate component. Now, you can achieve the same effect by simply using the <CodeHighlight>Button variant="glitch-brightness"</CodeHighlight>.

The <CodeHighlight>Button</CodeHighlight> now supports nine variants: <CodeHighlight>shine</CodeHighlight>, <CodeHighlight>animated-border</CodeHighlight>, <CodeHighlight>rotate-border</CodeHighlight>, <CodeHighlight>magnetic</CodeHighlight>, <CodeHighlight>animated-border</CodeHighlight>, <CodeHighlight>default</CodeHighlight>, <CodeHighlight>outline</CodeHighlight>, <CodeHighlight>success</CodeHighlight>, and <CodeHighlight>destructive</CodeHighlight>. You can now use <CodeHighlight>isMagnetic</CodeHighlight> as a prop for the magnetic button.

You can also use the <CodeHighlight>variant</CodeHighlight> props with <Link href="/ui/badge">Badge</Link>, <Link href="/ui/card">Card</Link>, and <Link href="/ui/text">Text</Link>.

To be honest, this feature's one of my favorites. It's a game changer for customizing components.

#### New Components 

<div className="relative w-full h-[250px] sm:h-[400px] rounded-xl border border-transparent dark:border-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-8 overflow-hidden">

<video src="/videos/v2.0/new-components.mp4" className="absolute z-10 inset-0 size-full object-cover rounded-[inherit]" autoPlay muted loop playsInline />

<Image src="/images/v2.0/new-components.jpg" className="absolute z-0 inset-0 size-full object-cover rounded-[inherit] blur-sm" alt="New components" />

</div>

All components were entirely reengineered from the ground up, including <Link href="/ui/accordion">Accordion</Link>, <Link href="/ui/checkbox">Checkbox</Link>, <Link href="/ui/switch">Switch</Link>, and <Link href="/ui/tooltip">Tooltip</Link>. Using <Link href="https://radix-ui.com/primitives" isExternal>Radix UI</Link> and <Link href="https://tailwindcss.com" isExternal>Tailwind v4</Link>, respecting user motion preferences.

Luxe is now much cleaner and simpler to use. The sidebar has been redesigned into a single component per category, making the docs far more organized. In v1.0, the sidebar had 34+ components, now it's down to just 13, powered by <CodeHighlight>variant</CodeHighlight> props.

<div className="overflow-hidden border border-transparent dark:border-neutral-900 rounded-2xl mt-8 mb-10">

<BlurImage src="/images/v2.0/sidebar.png" alt="Old/New components sidebar" width={1920} height={1000} />

</div>

</div>

<div className="space-y-4 pt-1.5">

#### New CLI

One of the most requested features was the ability to copy and paste components into your project with a single command. Now, you can do exactly that using the CLI.

<div className="relative w-full h-[200px] sm:h-[400px] rounded-xl border border-transparent dark:border-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-8 overflow-hidden">

<video src="/videos/v2.0/cli.mp4" className="absolute z-10 inset-0 size-full object-cover rounded-[inherit]" autoPlay muted loop playsInline />

<Image src="/images/v2.0/cli.jpg" className="absolute z-0 inset-0 size-full object-cover rounded-[inherit] blur-sm" alt="Variant props" />

</div>

You can learn more in the <Link href="/ui/cli">CLI docs</Link>. Start with <CodeHighlight>npx luxe init</CodeHighlight>, then use <CodeHighlight>npx luxe add</CodeHighlight> to add components to your project.

This marks a major step toward making Luxe more developer friendly and efficient. It's currently in beta, and we're actively refining it based on real world feedback. While it's already powerful, some commands and components may still evolve as we stabilize features and improve the developer experience.

This CLI was built in collab with <Link href="https://x.com/lucasaugustsof" isExternal>Lucas Augusto</Link>, a Design Systems Specialist and Creator of <Link href="https://github.com/lucasaugustsof/hynix" isExternal>Hynix</Link>. His experience in building developer tools was crucial, making his contribution essential to Luxe's future.

_"When I discovered Luxe and met its creator, I saw a great opportunity for growth. The gallery already featured visually stunning components what was missing was a developer friendly way to turn that art into code, accessible with just a few simple commands."_
