One of the biggest Luxe launches yet is here. This new version introduces powerful new components, a new CLI, and a complete redesign of everything.

My goal is to make building apps in the easiest way possible, using intuitive, beautiful, and functional components. This new version is a big step in that direction. I believe that what we want most is _“Build fast, ship with style”_.
